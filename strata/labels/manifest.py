"""The manifest: a materialised dataset's description of itself.

Written beside the files, and complete enough that nothing needs a database
to train from it. That is what makes a dataset version the portable unit —
the property ``project.py`` used to claim for a whole project directory, at
a granularity that survives the move to a catalog.

**The one file two packages have to agree on.** The catalog writes it and
modelling reads it, and neither may import the other. So the definition
lives here, where both can, rather than in the writer with the reader
reconstructing it from key names — which it did, and which meant a renamed
field read back as nothing instead of failing.

Sample ids are catalog-local, so ``checksum`` travels with them: files and
labels alone are enough to train anywhere, and the checksum is what lets a
different catalog match these samples to its own.

    longer exist. Widening the key is what lets the cache keep its stated
    property — nothing is ever invalidated — while ceasing to be wrong.

    Here rather than beside the feature declarations because two hosts
    compute it and a third stores it: the laptop keys its lookups with it,
    the modelling host its answers, and the prediction cache holds both. A
    digest that differed between them would not be wrong, only a cache that
    never hits — which is why the test pins its output rather than its
    properties.

    The empty digest is empty rather than a hash of nothing, so a project
    with no features reads exactly as it did before there were any.
